<p>Machine Learning Compass</p>
<h1 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h1>
<p>The purpose of this document is to help the reader to understand the ML without any prior knowledge from high level algorithms all the way to business use cases. Target audiences are Data Scientists, Cloud Architects, Product Managers, and Sales representatives</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Machine learning provides an alternative paradigm for developing capabilities. For conventional programming, a program is developed explicitly using one of multiple programming languages. With machine learning, the program is created implicitly using data. For machine learning, a computer can learn a specific task without being explicitly programmed to perform that task.</p>

<p>As the chart below shows, different problems can be solved using different types of algorithms or combinations of multiple algorithms. One of the most critical processes of data science is asking right questions to solve that impact the business. Based on the questions asked, we can experience the possible algorithms to find the most optimal solution.</p>

<h1 id="the-machine-learning-team">The Machine Learning Team</h1>
<p>The ML team is composed of individuals with various skill sets. Business leader who communicates with clients at a high-level and strategizes the plan and resources to successfully deliver the promises. Technical leader to collaborate with other technical team members to address any technical obstacles or challenges and plan out the technical roadmap to the final products. Data Engineer who is responsible for efficient ETL process as well as the deployment of model pipelines once it’s built. Data Scientist who is responsible for completing dots from asking questions to building powerful models.</p>
<p>The following are some of the primary skills required by the machine learning and data science domain to support an engagement. These skills are broken down into 5 high level categories: planning, formulation, modeling, production, and post production.</p>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>For planning activities the key parameters that need to be considered are how to generate business insights, increase collaboration, foster teamwork, planning the effort, and prototyping alternatives. The following activities are relevant in this phase:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Quantifying business value and defining key metrics</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="formulation">Formulation</h2>
<p>In the formulation phase of an effort the emphasis is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Statistical / ML thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idea abstraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process for data generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preprocessing the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring feature engineering ideas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the primary technical tools that are used in this phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python (pandas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R (especially the tidyverse package)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PySpark / SparkR</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
<p>During the modeling effort, traditional machine learning methods are employed. This is where techniques for general model training and tuning are performed - especially when deep learning methods are used. The primary tasks performed in this phase include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model exploration and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model training, validation and testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model selection</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the primary technical tools that are used in this phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scikit Learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning libraries such as Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Keras</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spark MLib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probabilistic machine learning libraries such as pymc3, and Edward</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>Once an ML capability has been developed and models have been produced, they will need to be placed into a production environment that will require a scalable deployment, performance and fault monitoring, fault-tolerance, maintenance and updates. Some of the tasks will include creation of a production quality system, creation of support for testing, development and execution of a plan for launching and updating the deployed components, support for monitoring performance, deployment as services that can be invoked from other systems and perhaps a dashboard or user interface to access the capabilities provided by the developed models.</p>
<p>Some of the primary technical tools that are used in this phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tableau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R-Shiny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GCP components such as DataFlow, Cloud Functions, BigQuery</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="post-production">Post Production</h2>
<p>Once the system is in production and has been leveraged, there will ultimately be the need to tune the models, retrain the models with newly collected data from the production system or from other sources, and perhaps even the replacement of the model when an alternative approach is discovered, or if the model does not continue to provide satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Some of the primary technical tools that are used in this phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AutoML</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/td7rSmhkd1hoJvdJxQcOIVtYLIS7pDndB80Ikd2EoTaTvN_Bvxxv8_jfZHYmEDMYFalFr_EE4zpKtQH2SMD7zIltFEXlnannzelNFosfARtBN2pGfHyHXCaZodAc9gxmur4LxS_5" alt=""></p>
